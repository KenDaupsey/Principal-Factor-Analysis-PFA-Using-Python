# Principal-Factor-Analysis-PFA-Using-Python

Introduction
Principal Factor Analysis (PFA) is a powerful statistical technique used to analyze the structure of interrelationships among a set of variables by identifying underlying latent factors or dimensions that explain the observed correlations or covariances. This project provides a Python implementation of PFA, allowing users to explore and interpret the factor structure of their data.

Features
Perform factor analysis on a dataset
Calculate the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy
Extract factor loadings
Examine the explained variance by the identified factors
Apply factor rotation methods (e.g., varimax rotation) for better interpretability
Visualize factor loadings before and after rotation
Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Install the required Python libraries:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib factor_analyzer
Usage
Open the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
Load your dataset or use the provided sample dataset.
Select the variables for factor analysis.
Run the code to perform factor analysis, calculate KMO, extract factor loadings, and examine the explained variance.
Optionally, apply factor rotation and visualize the factor loadings.
Examples
The project includes code examples demonstrating how to perform Principal Factor Analysis using the factor_analyzer library. The examples cover the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries
Loading the dataset
Selecting variables for factor analysis
Performing factor analysis
Calculating KMO
Extracting factor loadings
Examining the explained variance
Applying factor rotation (e.g., varimax rotation)
Visualizing factor loadings before and after rotation
